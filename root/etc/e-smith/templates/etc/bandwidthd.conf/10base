# An interval is 2.5 minutes, this is how many

# Graph cutoff is how many k must be transfered by an
# ip before we bother to graph it

#Put interface in promiscuous mode to score to traffic
#that may not be routing through the host machine.

#Libpcap format filter string used to control what bandwidthd see's
#Please always include "ip" in the string to avoid strange problems

#Draw Graphs - This default to true to graph the traffic bandwidthd is recording
#Usually set this to false if you only want cdf output or
#you are using the database output option.  Bandwidthd will use very little
